				<h2 class="about-heading">WHAT WE BELIEVE</h2>
				<h4 class="about-subhead">Stocks for the Long-Term</h4>
						<p>Stocks should be the core of your portfolio when investing over the long term and viewed holistically.  Buying individual stocks is fine, but isn’t the way to build a portfolio.  Highly-rated fixed income securities should be your core if your investment horizon is short (e.g., 5 years).</p>
						<h4 class="about-subhead">Diversification is Essential</h4>
						<p>All investment experts agree that diversification is essential for every portfolio.  However, diversification should be determined on the basis of an objective analysis of historical and current data over all market conditions and not on a preconceived notion of uncorrelated asset classes.</p>
						<h4 class="about-subhead">Adding Alpha</h4>
						<p>Our experience on Wall Street and proprietary technology enables us to enhance your returns by adding “alpha” through arbitrage trading, securities finance, eliminating unnecessary intermediaries, and minimizing expenses.</p>
